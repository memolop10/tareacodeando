            Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. 
            Extend the template language with your own components and use 
            a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific
             help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes
              together so you 
            can focus on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.</p>
